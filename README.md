# NLP to SQL Model

## Overview
The **NLP to SQL Model** is designed to convert natural language queries into SQL statements using transformer-based models. This enables users to interact with databases efficiently without requiring SQL knowledge.

## Features
- **Natural Language to SQL Conversion**: Translates human queries into SQL statements.
- **Fine-Tuning Support**: Adapt the model for domain-specific databases.
- **Pre-trained Model Integration**: Use existing models for quick deployment.
- **Query Accuracy Evaluation**: Assess performance using benchmark datasets.

## Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning**: Transformers, Hugging Face Datasets, PEFT
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow (optional)
- **Languages**: Python
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-to-sql.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd nlp-to-sql
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download a pre-trained model:
   ```sh
   from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer
   model_name = "your-model-name"
   model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
   ```

## Usage
1. **Input a natural language query**
2. **Generate an SQL query using the trained model**
3. **Validate and execute the SQL statement**

## Training & Evaluation
- Fine-tune the model with text-to-SQL datasets.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and exact match metrics.
- Optimize efficiency with LoRA and PEFT techniques.
